  <h3>1. Go to class regularly: </h3>

  </div>

  <p>
      I know this one is mind-numbingly obvious but it’s important. 
      Many professors lecture directly from PowerPoint and post the 
      slides to the internet. This makes it tempting to skip class, 
      download the lecture notes, and learn the material on your own. 
      Although you can probably get away with this in easy courses, 
      you’ll face problems in challenging ones. By skipping class, 
      you miss out on a few important things:
      Detailed verbal explanations that are key to understanding the material
The chance to ask questions and listen to the Q&A of other students
Special announcements
Opportunities for extra credit
It’s also important to consider how skipping class affects your reputation. 
In most classes, grades are somewhat subjective. 
This means that the grader’s perception of you can make or break your grade. 
If you frequently miss class, you’ll be perceived as someone who lacks 
respect for the professor and the subject matter. Why should they give you 
the benefit of the doubt or round that B+ up to an A-?
It sounds like a no-brainer, but it’s too important to not mention. 
Skipping class can make you look bad in the eyes of your professor. 
Since grades are somewhat subjective, it’s a good idea to avoid irritating 
the person who will be handing out the marks. If attendance is an issue, 
you could be stuck with a B versus the A- you deserve.

  <h3>2. Participate in class: </h3>

  <div class="image-div">
    <img src="../assets/imgs/image_five.PNG">
  </div>

  <p>
      If you’re shy or new to the college experience, it can be 
      difficult to muster enough courage to participate in class. 
      Nevertheless, that is exactly what you need to do. Class 
      participation shows the professor you are eager to learn. 
      It also increases the likelihood that you will remember 
      material from class to class.
      Not only will sitting in the front row build self confidence, 
      it will automatically engage you in the lecture. You’ll appear 
      to be an eager student and highly visible
      to the teacher. This will help your academic reputation and 
      make it more likely you’ll develop a relationship with the 
      professor. You’ll have a much easier time maintaining focus 
      and will feel more like a participant than a passive observer.
College lectures tend to build on previous material. If you encounter 
a lecture or concept that you do not understand, you should address 
the issue immediately to avoid getting completely lost. 
Confusing points can be clarified with help from your professors, 
classmates or library resources.

  <h3>3. Organize yourself: </h3>
  <p>
      If you don’t have a study strategy, you can study all day 
      and night and still not get anywhere. The only sure way to 
      make the most of your study time is to employ a study 
      strategy that complements your schedule and learning style.
Getting organized is one of the easiest ways to raise your GPA in 
college. When you’re organized, you automatically reduce the 
amount of time and effort that it takes to do well in college.
Things you should organize (besides your thoughts) include: your 
class schedule, notes, study time, reading assignments and handouts.
Different professors have different teaching styles. Some lecture, 
some use power point slides and some depend on handouts and textbooks. 
The inconsistency can make note-taking problematic from class to class. 
The best way to handle this is to develop a note-taking system that 
works with each professor’s teaching style.
The sooner you can get started on your assignments, the better. 
Try keeping a list of proven information sources, web apps and other 
dependable resources so that you can find something the second you need it.
 The saved time can be used to study, have fun or just sleep.

  <h3>4. Do a weekly study review: </h3>
  <p>
      A common problem students encounter is trying to learn an 
      enormous amount of material right before the midterm or 
      final exam. This is practically impossible. You’ll find 
      it much easier if you take a gradual approach to studying. 
      At least once a week, review your notes starting from the 
      beginning of the course. This only needs to take 15 or 
      20 minutes, just enough time to build familiarity with the material.
      By doing a weekly review you’ll gradually memorize everything and 
      will better understand how one concept builds on the next. 
      Putting in small amounts of effort on a consistent basis will 
      drastically reduce the amount of studying you need to do right 
      before the test.
  </p>
</div>
<div text-justify>
  <h3>5. Go to office hours: </h3>
  <p>
      Professors and TA’s usually make themselves available 
      at regular times during the week for students to ask 
      questions about assignments. Do yourself a favor by 
      taking advantage of this opportunity. First, attending 
      office hours will motivate you to get ahead on your work 
      and prepare questions to ask. This will give you a huge 
      edge in understanding problems that aren’t clearly 
      explained in the lectures. Second, it will build your 
      reputation as a high-effort student who deserves high grades.
      If you aren’t happy with the grades you’re currently getting, 
      you may want to consider talking to your professors. 
      Just remember to be polite. Throwing out wild accusations 
      or demanding that a grade be changed is almost never a good idea. 
      You will be better off asking about possible steps you could take 
      to improve your grade in each class.
  </p>
</div>
<div text-justify>
  <h3>6. Befriend with smart students with high GPA: </h3>
  <p>
      In courses that involve group work, this is essential. 
      No one wants to get stuck with a bunch slackers, have 
      to do all the work themselves, and end up with a poor 
      grade to show for it. The quality of the your learning 
      experience is directly related to the attitudes of the 
      people you work with. Working with smart people will 
      facilitate discussion. The best way to understand an 
      idea is talking about it with other intelligent people. 
      Who you work with also affects your academic reputation.
       If you associate with students that aren’t interested in 
       learning, teachers and graders will assume you feel the 
       same way. It’s also a great way to connect with people 
       who have similar interests and ambitions.
      You’re bound to make lots of friends in college. If you can, 
      try to spend some time with a study buddy who has a high GPA. 
      Your smart friend will be able to help you out when you 
      struggle and may prove to be a good influence should you 
      feel the urge to slack.
      Taking part in a study group is one of the best ways to stay 
      on track and raise your GPA. Study groups not only make you 
      accountable, they also force you to become more organized and 
      talk about what you have learned. If you can’t find a study 
      group to join, try forming one yourself.
  </p>
</div>
<div text-justify>
  <h3>7. Avoid all-nighters: </h3>
  <p>
      Generally, having to pull an all-nighter means that you slacked 
      off all semester and need to fit 3 months of learning into one day. 
      If you use a gradual study strategy this will never be necessary. 
      All-nighters don’t work! Yes, it might be possible to get a good 
      grade if the course is easy, but it’s much more likely that your 
      grade will be significantly lower. All-nighters harm performance 
      because they make you tired and stressed. You’ll also forget most 
      of what you learn right after the test, decreasing the practical 
      value of your education.
Although it’s good to spend a fair amount of time studying before a test, 
it’s just as important to get enough rest. Sleep improves concentration, 
solidifies what you have learned and improves your ability to organize 
and recall information. Poor performance in school can often be directly 
linked to sleep deprivation.

<div text-justify>
  <h3>8. Make use of Library: </h3>

  <div class="image-div">
    <img src="../assets/imgs/image_six.jpg">
  </div>

  <p>
      Dorm rooms aren’t the best place to study. It’s way too easy to 
      get distracted by roommates and visitors. Your study time canl 
      be more productive if you use your school’s library or a similar 
      facility. Every time you enter that building, your mind will shift 
      into work mode and stay there until you decide to leave.
You should read everything that is assigned to you and then some. 
Reading a lot makes you a better thinker, better writer and, most 
importantly, better student.
Although certain classes are more interesting (and more important) than 
others, it’s essential that you take every class seriously. If you can 
maintain a good grade in each class, it will make a huge difference on 
your overall grade point average.
  </p>
</div>
<div text-justify>
  <h3>9. Study Smart: </h3>
  <p>
      Some professors and schools offer opportunities for extra credit. 
      These opportunities are GPA gold mines; try to take advantage of them. 
      Extra credit can boost your average and enhance your college experience.
      Attending class can be a waste of time if you have a long commute or a 
      professor who likes to ramble. For this reason and many more, you may 
      want to consider taking some of your classes online. You’ll get to study 
      the same material and save time in the process.
College exams can have a huge impact on your GPA. To make sure you’re ready on 
test day, begin studying as soon as you can. Take a little time to review the 
subject matter each day so you’ll be better prepared than you would be if you 
waited until the last minute to cram.
  </p>

<div text-justify>
  <h3>10. Set a Goal and Reward Yourself: </h3>
  <p>
      Good grades are their own reward, but it doesn’t 
      hurt to have a little extra incentive. Try setting 
      a GPA goal and rewarding yourself with something 
      that you really want after you achieve it.
That’s all. Follow these 10 steps and you will see your 
GPA shoot through the roof. Good luck.
